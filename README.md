## Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)

The CCC consists of two distinct sections or “papers”: the Junior Division paper and the Senior Division paper. Each paper consists of 5 questions. Each question is worth 15 points. The range of difficulty increases from the first question to the last question on each paper. The CCC is held online in February. 

## Canadian Computing Olympiad (CCO)

Winners of the CCC will be invited to compete in the Canadian Computing Olympiad (CCO). Competing in the CCO is by invitation only and it is held in May.
